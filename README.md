During my stay at UPV I am taking the reinforcement learning class.<br>
Since the class is mostly based on [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) I decided to do some of the exercises described in the book.<br>
This repository contains my exercises aswell as the lecture assignment solutions.
