# Reinforcement Learning and AlphaZero Resources  

During my stay at UPV, I am taking a reinforcement learning class. Since the class is primarily based on [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html), I decided to work on some of the exercises described in the book.  

This repository contains:  
- My solutions to the exercises from the book.  
- The lecture assignment solutions.  

## AlphaZero Presentation  

This repository also includes a folder named `presentation`, which contains the materials for a presentation I prepared on AlphaZero. The presentation provides an overview of the algorithm, its underlying concepts, and its application to board games like chess and Go. The folder also contains some jupyter notebooks which I used to explain the model.

### Resources Used  

To create the presentation, I used the following key resources:  
- [AlphaZero From Scratch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/foersterrobert/AlphaZeroFromScratch): A detailed implementation of AlphaZero, which served as a reference for understanding the algorithm's structure.  
- [DeepMind Lecture Series on Reinforcement Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuSQpLinRB4&t=5780s): This lecture series offered valuable insights into AlphaZero's training process and the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.  
- [AlphaZero Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.01815): *Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm*, the foundational paper that describes AlphaZero's architecture and methodology.  

These resources provided a strong foundation for understanding and presenting AlphaZero's concepts effectively.
